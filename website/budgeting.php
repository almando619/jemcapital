                A business that does not have a budget runs the danger of being unprepared.
                If a business does not build a cushion for unexpected expenses and investments,
                it runs the risk of not being able to meet those obligations when they come due.
                Also, without a budget, a business risks having expense eat too much into the revenue,
                therefore reducing its profit, and possibly putting the business itself at risk
            </p>

                A well-planned budget gives you financial control. You will know how much funds are coming in and how much is going out.
                You can put limits on the expenses to avoid overspending.
                Your organization will also have the capacity of moving money around and allocating it efficiently.
